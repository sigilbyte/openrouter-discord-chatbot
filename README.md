## what you need

- [bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- Discord bot token
- OpenRouter API Key

## how to install

1. clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sigilbyte/openrouter-discord-chatbot.git
cd openrouter-discord-chatbot
```

2. install dependencies using bun:
```bash
bun install
```

3. create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```
to get your OpenRouter API Key, sign up on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).
to get your Discord bot token, follow the instructions below.

## setup your discord bot

1. create an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):
![create app](assets/images/image.png)
2. configure bot installation in installation tab:
![bot installation](assets/images/image-1.png)
Copy the Install link for later.

## configure the .env
in your dotenv file, you will need to set the following variables:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: the bot token you have created in the Discord Developer Portal

## how to use the bot
after setting everything up in the discord developer portal, open the Install link you copied earlier to add the bot to your server.
#### run bot script:
open your terminal and run:
```bash
cd openrouter-discord-bot

inside the discord server where your bot is active, you can now use the following commands:
#### chat with bot:
```
!ai <your message>
```
#### switch model:
```
!ai-model <model_id>
```
#### print available model ids:
```
!ai-model print
```

- [ ] function calling

additionally i plan to add improvements for user-friendliness and integration:

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **note**: this is a wip and the code is not yet optimized for production use. feel free to contact me on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/sigilbyte) to discuss your ideas or contribute to the project. I want to build in public and meet motivated devs on the way to collaborate with.ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
